## Idiot-proof steps for *me* (future-Harry)

1. **Add a new page**  
   - Go to this repo in GitHub.  
   - Click **Add file → Upload files**.  
   - Drop in your new HTML file (e.g. `BikeShed-Day2-Leaflet-Map.html`).  
   - Commit changes.  
   - It will publish automatically at  
     `https://valr-adv.github.io/FILENAME.html`

2. **Update the homepage (`index.html`)**  
   - Edit `index.html` to add a new “card” or link pointing to your new file.  
   - Commit changes.  
   - Refresh `https://valr-adv.github.io/` and check the link works.

3. **Check GitHub Pages settings** (just in case)  
   - Repo **Settings → Pages → Source** should be set to  
     *Deploy from a branch → main branch → /(root)*.  
   - Tick **Enforce HTTPS** if it’s not already.
